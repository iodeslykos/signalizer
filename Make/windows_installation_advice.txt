Choose a build variant, like x86 if you are running a 32-bit DAW or x64 if you're running 64-bit.

For instance, for 64-bit, open the "Release x.y.z x64" folder.

Select the "Signalizer" folder and copy the folder (and not just the .DLL inside!) into your VSTPlugins folder. That's it!

-------------------

If you're unsure about where your VSTPlugins folder is, it can be very custom and I'd advise to research the internet for your particular DAW if you didn't choose it yourself.

If you're having issues, you can try above again but use the "Debug" variant that can provide better error messages.
