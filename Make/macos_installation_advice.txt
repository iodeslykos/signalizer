Choose a build variant, like x86 if you are running a 32-bit DAW or x64 if you're running 64-bit.

For instance, for 64-bit, open the "x64" folder. Note that Apple has deprecated x86 builds even a while back, so I'm generally unable to provide them.

Select the "Signalizer" folder plugin:
- Signalizer.component for AudioUnit
- Signalizer.vst for VST2.4
- Signalizer.vst3 for VST3

and copy the plugin appropriately into your (user) Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/ folder. That's it!

You may need to restart your computer after you've done this.

-------------------

If you're unsure about where your Plug-Ins folder is, it can be very custom and I'd advise to research the internet for your particular operating system if you didn't choose it yourself.

You may need to allow opening apps from unidentified developers, because Apple otherwise requires developers to pay them fees annually.
