Choose a build variant, like x86 if you are running a 32-bit DAW or x64 if you're running 64-bit.

For instance, for 64-bit, open the "x64" folder. Note that Apple has deprecated x86 builds even a while back, so I'm generally unable to provide them.

Select the "Signalizer" folder plugin:
- Signalizer.component for AudioUnit
- Signalizer.vst for VST2.4
- Signalizer.vst3 for VST3

and copy the plugin appropriately into your (user) Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/ folder. That's it!

You may need to restart your computer after you've done this.

If you're unsure about where your Plug-Ins folder is, it can be very custom and I'd advise to research the internet for your particular operating system if you didn't choose it yourself.

*** IF MACOS TELLS YOU THE PLUGIN IS DAMAGED AND CAN'T BE OPENED: ***

First, make sure you downloaded this from the only official source:
https://bitbucket.org/Mayae/signalizer/downloads/

This happens because Apple's Gatekeeper quarantines software not downloaded from Apple's own store and/or unsigned software. It costs me $99 a year to notarize this program, and I don't currently have plans on paying Apple for this. Some thoughts are offered on this from Ardour developers here:

It's possible to circumvent these checks but for obvious reasons I cannot recommend this unless you are experienced with using the terminal and trust the source program.

Alternatively, you can allow opening apps from unidentified developers:
